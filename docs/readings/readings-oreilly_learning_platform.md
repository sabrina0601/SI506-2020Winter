# O'Reilly Learning Platform

O'Reilly Media, Inc. is a major tech publisher that provides an online learning platform. The Michigan Library has an agreement with O'Reilly that allows you to access O'Reilly's extensive catalogue of books and videos hosted on their platform without a paid subscription (i.e., free access).

You will need to register for an O'Reilly learning platform "school" account to access a number of the SI 506 assigned readings.

## Registration

1. Create a school account using your `<uniqname>@umich.edu` email address by visiting [https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/temporary-access/](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/temporary-access/)

2. From the dropdown, select "Not listed? Click here."

3. Then enter your `<uniqname>@umich.edu` email address. O'Reilly will send you an account activation email. Click the embedded red button to activate your account. You now have free access to hundreds of titles and videos.

:warning: avoid https://www.oreilly.com/member/, clicking "sign in with google" using your `<uniqname>@umich.edu` email address. Doing so starts a free 10-day trial, and your email address is tagged by O'Reilly in a way that prevents you from activating your account as a UMich student. If you make this mistake (inadvertently) please contact me at `arwhyte@umich.edu` or O'Reilly Customer Service directly at `support@oreilly.com` or by phone at 707-827-7019 or 800-889-8969 and explain your situation. Customer Service will move your "trapped" member account to the UMich school account.
