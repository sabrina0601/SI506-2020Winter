# Readings: Week 03

Lecture 03 kicked off a discussion of Python objects, variables, types, statements, expressions and arithmetic operators.  We will explore these topics in more detail this week along with immutable strings and mutable, though ordered, lists.

## Objects, Variables, Expressions, and Statements

**Charles Severance, [Python for Everybody. Exploring data in Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book) (CreateSpace, 2016).**

:bulb: Entry point for the beginner.

Read Chapter 2, "Variables, Expressions, and Statements".

**Jake VanderPlas, [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-whirlwind-tour/9781492037859/) (O'Reilly Media, 2016).**

Read section ["Basic Python Semantics: Variables and Objects"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-whirlwind-tour/9781492037859/ch01.html#basic-python-semantics-variables-and-objects).

A short section that should help clarify what constitutes an object in Python (in short, nearly everything) and how to think about variables. Jake's book is also available in [Github](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython).

## Data Types

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["Understanding Data Types in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-data-types-in-python-3)" (DigitalOcean, Sept 2016).**

A useful introduction to the various Python data types that you will get to know and love this semester: string, integer, float, boolean, list, tuple, and dictionary.

## Strings

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["An Introduction to Working with Strings in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-working-with-strings-in-python-3)" (DigitalOcean, Sept 2016).**

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["How To Format Text in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-format-text-in-python-3) (DigitalOcean, Sept 2016).**

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["An Introduction to String Functions in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-string-functions-in-python-3) (DigitalOcean, Nov 2016).**

Taken together Lisa Tagliaferri's three articles provide an economical introduction for coming to grips with the string data type. Note that the string data type provides you with a number of string manipulation methods such as `str.join()`, `str.split()`, and `str.replace()`. Note too the always useful built-in `len()` function which returns the number of elements in a sequences like strings and lists.

## String Methods Reference

**w3schools, ["Python String Methods"](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp) (w3schools.com, nd).**

Not quite a cheat sheet but close. Use it as a reference.

## Lists

**Eric Matthes, [Python Crash Course](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781492071266/), 2nd Edition (No Starch Press, 2019).**

Read Chapter 3, ["Introducing Lists"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781492071266/xhtml/ch03.xhtml#ch03).

Eric Matthes' book is an engaging read. Unlike many starter books on Python he introduces the list data type and working with list elements early in the conversation.

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["Understanding Lists in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-lists-in-python-3) (DigitalOcean, Nov 2016).**

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["How To Use List Methods in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-list-methods-in-python-3) (DigitalOcean, Nov 2016).**

Lisa Tagliaferri is another author I like. Like Eric she provides a solid introduction to the `list` data type and list methods such as `list.append()`, `list.insert()`, `list.remove()`, `list.pop()`, `list.copy()`, and `list.sort()`.

## List Methods Reference

**w3schools, ["Python List Methods"](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp) (w3schools.com, nd).**

Not quite cheat sheets but close. Use them as a reference.
