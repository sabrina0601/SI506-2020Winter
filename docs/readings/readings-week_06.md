# Readings: Week 06

This week you will encounter a new data type, the dictionary.  Python dictionaries are considered associative arrays, wherein each value defined within the dictionary is associated with a key that is used to access the value. You'll often hear people refer to dictionaries as unordered sets of key-value pairs or as maps.

Last week you were introduced to Python's slicing notation. Last weeks focus was on list slicing. This week you will learn to slice strings. Recall that the string data type is considered a sequence (as is the list data type) and a substring can be returned from a string via slicing.

I've also included the article you first read in [Week 04](./readings-week_04.md) that describes eight common exceptions that appear in tracebacks. You've no doubt encountered some of these exceptions previously. As you start working with dictionaries you'll want to familiarize yourself with the `KeyError` exception. Slicing operations gone awray can raise an `IndexError` so review that exception as well.

## Dictionaries

**Charles Severance, [Python for Everybody. Exploring data in Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book) (CreateSpace, 2016).**

:bulb: Entry point for the beginner.

Read Chapter 9 “Dictionaries”

Read Chuck on working with dictionaries. Then read Eric's chapter and review Lisa's article.

**Eric Matthes, [Python Crash Course](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781492071266/), 2nd Edition (No Starch Press, 2019).**

Read Chapter 6 ["Dictionaries"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781492071266/xhtml/ch06.xhtml#ch06).

Eric's chapter is particularly good at describing how to loop over a dictionary.  He also provides examples of more complex dictionary values such as lists and other dictionaries.

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["Understanding Dictionaries in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-dictionaries-in-python-3) (Digital Ocean, Sept 2016).**

Lisa's offers a compact primer that I highly recommend.

## Dictionary Methods Reference

**w3schools, ["Python Dictionary Methods"](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_dictionary.asp) (w3schools.com, nd).**

Not quite a cheat sheet but close. Use it as a reference.

## Dictionaries Cheat Sheet

Eric Matthes, ["Beginner's Python Cheat Sheet - Dictionaries "](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e/blob/master/cheat_sheets/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc_dictionaries.pdf).

## Slicing strings

**Lisa Tagliaferri, ["How to Index and Slice Strings in Python 3"](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-index-and-slice-strings-in-python-3) (Digital Ocean, Sept 2016).**

Lisa discusses how to index and slice character sequences using Python's slicing notation.

## Exceptions

**Chad Hansen, ["Understanding the Python Traceback"](https://realpython.com/python-traceback/) (RealPython, 2019).**

Chad discusses the "traceback", an error report issued by the Python Interpreter whenever the code you write triggers an exception. I will reference this article frequently in the weekly readings. For this week skim the article again and then read closely the subsection covering the `KeyError`:

* What is a Python Traceback?
* How do you Read a Python Trackback?
* What are some Common Tracebacks in Python?
* (following exceptions _only_)
  * AttributeError
  * IndentionError
  * IndexError
  * __KeyError__
  * NameError
  * SyntaxError
  * TypeError
