# SI 506: Programming I (2020 Winter)

### Prerequisites: None

## Course Description
SI 506 is designed for graduate students with little or no programming experience. SI 506 together
with SI 507 constitutes an introductory course series that focuses on programming fundamentals.
As a foundational course SI 506 serves as a prerequisite for SI 507 along with other more advanced
MSI/MHI courses.

Again, no one who enrolls in this course is expected to have any prior programming experience.
The programming language of instruction is [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/), a
general-purpose, object-oriented, dynamically typed, interpreted language popular among
developers and data scientists.

## Learning Objectives
Leverage Python at the introductory level to
* analyze computing problems thoughtfully
* solve computing challenges skillfully
* debug runtime errors quickly
* process data efficiently
* prepare for SI 507

## Topics
Key topics covered in this course include:
* Python installation
* source code editor and Bash shell use
* Python Interpreter
* syntax and semantics
* values and variables,
* expressions and statements
* strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples
* sequence indexing and slicing
* operators, conditional statements, and truth-value tests
* for loops, while loops, and control statements
* functions: user-defined functions, built-in functions, and type methods
* nested data structures
* module imports
* errors, exceptions, and exception handling (try/except)
* debugging
* file read/write (text, CSV, JSON)
* interacting with a REST API
* data processing

## Teaching Team
The SI 506 teaching team consists of the following members:

## Communications
We use the [Piazza Q&A platform](https://piazza.com) to "crowd source" responses to programming
questions and other issues of general concern. Contributions are not required but are encouraged.

If you have a question that pops up outside the lecture, lab, or office hours, post it on the
Piazza Q&A platform. You can access Piazza via Canvas (you can also log in through Piazza directly
after you have enrolled in our 'Piazza class' by clicking a link in an email or doing so on the
Canvas site).

:exclamation: Avoid emailing your GSI or instructor directly with a programming question.
Broadcast it on Piazza so that your classmates can participate in helping resolve your issue.

:warning: Also, please do not post problem set solutions on Piazza.

### Announcements
General announcements and reminders will be posted to Canvas using the Announcements tool.

### Personal concerns
If a personal concern or private matter requires communications with the instructor __only__,
never hesitate to talk to Anthony directly or email him at <arwhyte@umich.edu>.

Feel free to also contact the
UMSI [Office of Student Affairs](https://www.si.umich.edu/academics/office-student-affairs)
(OASA) if an issue arises that poses a challenge to your academic success. UMSI students can
reach the OASA support team at the following email addresses:

* MSI students: <umsi.advising.msi@umich.edu>
* MHI students: <umsi.advising.mhi@umich.edu>

OASA is especially useful if an emergency requires you to step away from your coursework. OASA can
help reach out to all your instructors in order to make them aware of your situation. OASA is also
an excellent resource if you have questions about enrollment, retention, graduation, and career
success. You can also contact OASA whenever you require academic or personal advising while in the
program.

## Assignments

SI 506 will feature weekly readings, problem sets, and lab activities. The weekly rhythm of
assignments will help establish a regular, repeated pattern of learning in small "chunks".

Assignment due dates will be posted on Canvas. Canvas is the source of truth for due dates and
scores.

### Readings
Readings are a key component of this course. The readings complement and amplify each
lecture and lab. Readings should be completed before you attempt any of the accompanying problem
set assignments. There is nothing to submit after completing a reading, but be prepared to budget
time to engage with the content thoughtfully.  

Many of the texts will be sourced from O'Reilly, a prodigious publisher of computing monographs,
videos, tutorials, and related content. O'Reilly provides an online platform for accessing its
content that you can access free of charge as a U-M student. See the U-M
Library [instructions](https://www.lib.umich.edu/announcements/oreilly-safari-books-online) for
creating an account or visit https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/temporary-access/ and
log in with your U-M email address (account confirmation required).

### Problem sets
Problem sets comprising one or more programming problems to be solved using Python will be assigned
weekly. Each programming assignment provides an opportunity to write code, solve programming
problems, and demonstrate your increasing fluency in the language.

You can earn up to 100 points per problem set completed and submitted. Submissions are scored
using an auto grader, itself written in Python. Problem set assignments will be released on
Tuesday and must be completed and submitted no later than the following Monday evening at 11:59 PM
Eastern time. No problem set scores will be dropped. Instead, there are extra credit points to be
earned via lab exercises.

### Labs
GSI-led labs are designed to both reinforce and explore further programming concepts and topics
discussed during the lectures. Labs require active participation to be effective. Discussion,
Q&A, and problem-solving activities will predominate.

Weekly labs will feature an exercise worth 20 points of extra credit. The points are earned by
submitting code or a related deliverable. Lab exercises will be released on Tuesday and must be
completed and submitted no later than the following Monday evening at 11:59 PM Eastern time. A
maximum of 220 extra credit points can be earned across the semester.

### In-Class Midterm Exam
An in-class, "open book, open network" midterm exam will be held on Thursday, 27 February, 2020.
The midterm exam is worth 1000 points. More details regarding the midterm exam will be provided in
class.

:exclamation: If the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office has issued you a
test-related accommodation please inform Anthony at least two weeks before the midterm date.

### Final Assignment
The weekly problem sets are designed to prepare you for submitting a final assignment that will
involve writing a Python program designed to combine, filter, and clean data sourced from multiple
data sets. The final project is worth 1500 points. The final assignment will be released on Tuesday,
14 April and will be due no later than Thursday, 30 April, 11:59 PM Eastern.

## Assignment Scoring
Problems sets will be scored using a Python auto grader. Other assignments may use auto graders
and/or be scored manually. Instructions on how to submit assignments will be provided. Scores
will be posted on Canvas.

### Auto Grader/Scoring issues
If you have a concern about a score on any assignment, believe that we've missed something and
want us to check, or desire a score explanation or re-grade, please contact your GSI.  If
warranted your concern will be escalated to Anthony.

### Late Policy
Late assignments will be penalized 10% of the total points to be earned _each_ day the submission is
overdue. An assignment that is submitted > three (3) calendar days after the due date will
receive a score of zero (0).

## Final Grade
Total points earned in the course will translate to the following letter grades:

| Grade | Points | Percentage |
| :---- | -----: | :--------- |
| A+ | 3880 | 97% |
| A | 3720 | 93% |
| A- | 3600 | 90% |
| B+ | 3480 | 87% |
| B | 3360 | 84% |
| B- | 3240 | 81% |
| C+ | 3120 | 78% |
| C | 3000 | 75% |
| C- | 2880 | 72% |
| D+ | 2760 | 69% |
| D | 2640	| 66% |
| D- | 2520	| 63% |
| E | \<= 2519 | |

:exclamation: Total points earned that fall between any of the points/letter grade thresholds
listed above will result in the _lower_ of the two letter grades being awarded.
_Example_: 3700 points earned translates to an A- not an A.

:warning: Recall that SI 506 is a required course for UMSI students. As such, a grade of D+ or
less in the course will not count for degree credit and SI 506 will need to be repeated. See the
MHI and MSI Student handbook's "Grades and Grading Policy" for a more complete description of letter
grades and their interpretation.

## Academic Integrity and Misconduct

### Collaboration
UMSI strongly encourages collaboration while working on some assignments, such as homework problems
and interpreting reading assignments as a general practice. Active learning is effective.
Collaboration with other students in the course will be especially valuable in summarizing the
reading materials and picking out the key concepts. You must, however, write your homework
submission on your own, in your own words, before turning it in. If you worked with someone on the
homework before writing it, you must list any and all collaborators on your written submission.

If you are a more advanced student and are willing to help other students, please feel free to do
so. Just remember that your goal is to help teach the material to the student receiving the help
and not do their work for them.

For example, when working on SI 506 problem sets, add a comment in your Python code when citing a
fellow classmate's assistance. Reference each student collaborator using their uniqname:

```python
# Worked on lines 10-15 with nantin and ssciolla.
```

Each course and each instructor may place restrictions on collaboration for any or all assignments.
Read the instructions careful and request clarification about collaboration when in doubt.
Collaboration is almost always forbidden for take-home and in class exams.

### Plagiarism
All submitted work must be your own original work unless otherwise specified in a specific
assignment. Asking someone to contribute to or complete your work or copying work of another
student is a form of academic misconduct (cheating). The use of ideas or expressions from others
without attribution is another form of academic misconduct (plagiarism). Any violation of the
School’s policy on Academic and Professional Integrity (found in the student handbooks) will
result in serious penalties. These range from failing an assignment, to failing a course, to
being expelled from the program. Violations of academic and professional integrity will be
reported to the UMSI academic integrity officer. Consequences impacting assignment or course grades
are determined by the faculty instructor; additional sanctions may be imposed by the Senior
Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you think you need an accommodation for a disability, please inform Anthony at your earliest
convenience. Some aspects of this course, including the assignments, in-class activities, and the
way the course is usually taught may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress.
As soon as you make Anthony aware of your needs, he can work with the Services for Students with
Disabilities (SSD) office to help determine appropriate academic accommodations. The SSD office
(734-763-3000) http://ssd.umich.edu typically recommends accommodations through a Verified
Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form. Any information you provide is private
and confidential and will be treated as such.

## Religious holidays
The Office of the Provost maintains a [list](http://www.provost.umich.edu/calendar/religious_holidays19-20.html) of religious holidays that may pose a conflict with the 2010-2020 academic calendar.  

Although the University of Michigan, as an institution, does not observe religious holidays, it has
long been the University's policy that every reasonable effort should be made to help students
avoid negative academic consequences when their religious obligations conflict with academic
requirements. Absence from classes or examinations for religious reasons does not relieve students
from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence.
Students who expect to miss classes, examinations, or other assignments as a consequence of their
religious observance shall be provided with a reasonable alternative opportunity to complete such
academic responsibilities. It is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable
notice of the dates of religious holidays on which they will be absent. Such notice must be given
by the drop/add deadline of the given term. Students who are absent on days of examinations or
class assignments shall be offered an opportunity to make up the work, without penalty, unless it
can be demonstrated that a make-up opportunity would interfere unreasonably with the delivery of
the course. Should disagreement arise over any aspect of this policy, the parties involved should
contact the Department Chair, the Dean of the School, or the Ombudsperson. Final appeals will be
resolved by the Provost.

## Student Mental Health and Well-being

The University of Michigan is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its
students, while acknowledging that a variety of issues, such as strained relationships,
increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, and depression, directly impacts students’ academic
performance. If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of
support, services are available. For help, contact Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)
at (734) 764-8312 and https://caps.umich.edu/ during and after hours, on weekends and holidays or
through its counselors physically located in schools on both North and Central Campus. You may also
consult University Health Service (UHS) at (732) 764-8320 and
https://www.uhs.umich.edu/mentalhealthsvcs, or for alcohol or drug concerns,
see www.uhs.umich.edu/aodresources.  For a more comprehensive listing of the broad range of
mental health services available on campus, please visit: http://umich.edu/~mhealth/.
