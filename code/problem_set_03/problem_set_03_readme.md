# SI 506: Problem Set 03

Dataset: Video Game Console Sales ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console))

This week's problem set includes five (5) problems that utilize your knowledge of for-loops,
indexing, slicing, and functions. Problems 1 and 2 review how slicing and for-loops work. In
Problems 3 and 4, you will build utility functions to perform specific tasks given the data
available. In Problem 5, you will combine your skills to craft a main() function that will
call the functions from Problems 3 and 4 in order to perform a useful analysis.

Retrieve the problem set 03 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/problem_set_03)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_03.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
