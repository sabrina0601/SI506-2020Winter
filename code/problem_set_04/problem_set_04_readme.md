# SI 506: Problem Set 04

This week's problem set includes six (6) problems that involve working with dictionaries. 
Problems 3-6 provide further opportunities to craft functions that perform a number of 
operations on a multi-line string using dictionaries.

Retrieve the problem set 04 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/problem_set_04)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_04.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
