# SI 506: Problem Set 02

This week's problem set includes five (5) problems that work with functions, parameters,
exceptions, and conditionals. You will construct three (3) functions from scratch, debug a function,
and practice calling functions.

Retrieve the problem set 02 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/problem_set_02)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_02.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
