# SI 506: Lab Exercise 02

This week's lab exercise includes two (2) one to two line problems that focus on variables
creation and value assignment, string concatenation, and use a certain built-in function 
discussed in the lectures and the readings.

Retrieve the lab exercise 02 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/lab_exercise_02)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`lab_exercise_02.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your exercise as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.

The general layout of a SI 506 lab exercise resembles the following:

```python
# START LAB EXERCISE 01
print('LAB EXERCISE 01 \n')

# PROBLEM 01A (25 points)
# Instructions for problem 01A provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN 01A SOLUTION

# Write your 01A solution between the BEGIN/END comments.

# Not that for certain problems a required variable may be
# initialized with a default value (e.g., var_int = 0, var_str = '')
# that you will then change. print() statements are occasionally
# provided as a courtesy in order to output variable values
# to the screen.

# END 01A SOLUTION


# START PROBLEM 01B SETUP (do not modify)

# WARNING: For some problems a "setup" section is included in order
# to provide variables, functions or other working code for use
# with the problem(s). Do not change any code located between
# START/END SETUP.

# END SETUP

# PROBLEM 01B (25 points)
# Instructions for problem 01A provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN 01B SOLUTION

# Write your 01B solution between the BEGIN/END comments. . . .

# END 01B SOLUTION

# Additional problems may follow, structured similarly to problems 01A and 01B above.

# END LAB EXERCISE
```
