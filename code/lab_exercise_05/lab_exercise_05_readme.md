# SI 506: Lab Exercise 05

This week's lab focuses on a new data construct, dictionaries. You will complete four
exercises involving dictionaries so that you can become familiar with how they work,
and why they are so important to python.

Retrieve the lab exercise 05 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/lab_exercise_05)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`lab_exercise_05.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recorded and displayed.  You may re-submit your exercise as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
