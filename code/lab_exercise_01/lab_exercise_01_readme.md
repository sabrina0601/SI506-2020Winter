# SI 506: Lab Exercise 01

This week's lab exercise includes two (2) one to two line problems that focus on variables
creation and value assignment. The primary goal of this lab assignment is simply to provide
you with an early introduction to Python variables and to make sure your editor and environment
are set up correctly (some of the code here will only run if you have Python 3 installed). 

Retrieve the lab exercise 01 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/lab_exercise_01) 
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`lab_exercise_01.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your exercise as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.

The general layout of a SI 506 lab exercise resembles the following:

```python
# START LAB EXERCISE 01
print('LAB EXERCISE 01 \n')

# PROBLEM 01A (25 points)
# Instructions for problem 01A provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN 01A SOLUTION

# Write your 01A solution between the BEGIN/END comments.

# Not that for certain problems a required variable may be
# initialized with a default value (e.g., var_int = 0, var_str = '')
# that you will then change. print() statements are occasionally
# provided as a courtesy in order to output variable values
# to the screen.

# END 01A SOLUTION


# START PROBLEM 01B SETUP (do not modify)

# WARNING: For some problems a "setup" section is included in order
# to provide variables, functions or other working code for use
# with the problem(s). Do not change any code located between
# START/END SETUP.

# END SETUP

# PROBLEM 01B (25 points)
# Instructions for problem 01A provided here. Read carefully.

# BEGIN 01B SOLUTION

# Write your 01B solution between the BEGIN/END comments. . . .

# END 01B SOLUTION

# Additional problems may follow, structured similarly to problems 01A and 01B above.

# END LAB EXERCISE
```
